        <p>JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.</p>

        <p>The ng add command is used to add support for an external library to your project. It adds the npm package for a published library to your workspace, and makes your default app project to use that library, in whatever way is specified by the library's schematic. For example, if you add @angular/pwa, then it will configure your project for PWA support.</p>
